## Film Query Project

### Week 7 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Overview
This week's assignment was to create an application that was able to search through a database of films, and return query results to the user. The user needed the ability to look up a film by it's ID in the database, in addition to being able to search for movies using a search keyword that would check the movie's title and description. The query should display the found movies' title, description, release year, and rating. The query would also show a list of actors, and the movies' language, which came from other tables.

### Technologies/Topics Applied
This project required the implementation of many new technologies and concepts that I'd just had first exposure to, including SQL, mySQL, JDBC, Maven, prepared statements, connection objects, drivers and more.

### Lessons Learned
Working with databases requires patience, but I did find it to be quite enjoyable. The sheer amount of data in front of my face was a large departure from the previous projects' data that was generated by me, or the user of my app. It was important to understand how I was connecting to my database using Java, how to output SQL properly in my code, and how to accurately read in data that I queried. Overall, I felt like this was a fantastic learning experience.
